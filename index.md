## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a junior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell, on track to complete the Master of Engineering degree program in Biomedical Engineering (concentrated in Biomechanics & Mechanobiology) during my 8th and 9th semesters. My passion for building and creating is matched by a commitment to make a meaningfully tangible impact in healthcare. Continuing the momentum from leading an R&D team in the development of a ventilated prosthetic suspension system, I'm driven to pursue a career of innovating medical technologies that enhance patient well-being and quality of life.
