As a group in MAE3260 System Dynamics, our mutual interests guided us to choose a cardiovascular system to explore as our final project. More specifically, we decided to model a single-lead pacemaker due to its well-defined mechanisms that share familiar facets to what we’ve seen through our experience in 3260. My individual contribution is analyzing the dynamics involved in using the Van der Pol model of a heartbeat and deriving the state space and block diagram of this system to demonstrate the connection between naturally occurring dysfunctions of the heart and the man-made technology induced upon it to return rhythm and beat pace to normal/acceptable values.
